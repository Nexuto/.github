# Nexuto

Nexuto is a modular application builder designed to create AI-powered applications by leveraging a distributed architecture. It combines the concepts of "Nexus" and "æˆ¸" (meaning "door" or "connection" in Japanese), symbolizing its role as a gateway between various computational resources. 

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Nexuto allows you to build applications by hosting multiple WebSocket servers that can be integrated via a central hub. This distributed system is designed to efficiently manage resources across different servers.
- **Dynamic Function Discovery**: The application automatically scans files to identify callable functions, enabling seamless integration of different modules or plugins into the WebSocket server.
- **Resource Optimization**: Nexuto enables optimal resource allocation by allowing AI models or intensive computations to run on servers with GPUs, while lighter tasks are handled by servers with weaker CPUs.
- **Visual Block-Based Interface**: The hub provides an interface where WebSocket URLs can be input, revealing blocks that represent different functionalities. These blocks can be connected via wires to define the workflow of your application.
- **Scalability**: You can host multiple WebSocket servers but connect them all through a single hub, simplifying management and scaling.
